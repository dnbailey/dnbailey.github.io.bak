A photograph a day for the last three months has been eye opening. I wanted to share what I have learned during the first part of my 365 project.

###Lesson #1: I hate taking photos.

Okay, so I don’t really hate taking photos. However, there are days when I just don’t feel like taking photos. What I really hate is starting. Starting is tough! Once you get in the flow, creating is fun and exciting, but the first few moments of a starting to create is true work.

There are many days when my creative batteries are drained. Creativity comes in cycles, and there are always low points. What I have learned is that you have to keep creating even in the low points. Only by creating constantly will you move forward.

Evening Rain was created during a low point. I was just feeling drained. Just wanting to get my photo done for the day, I went out just after a brief rain shower. Everything was dripping in bright highlights. The back of my car was glittering, so I grabbed a few frames.

For some reason this image has become one of my favorites. It just speaks to me. It propelled me to start examining even the ordinary things around me.

###Lesson #2: I like flowers.

Never in a million years would I have guessed I liked photographing flowers as much as I do. For me the flowers symbolize a moment — a breath, a feeling, a thought. Learning this has allowed me to find a simple way of expressing myself.

Fresh blossoms are interesting. However, fading flowers are my favorite. There is something powerfully moving to me about a flower wilting. They are some of the most beautiful images to me. The texture and the shapes are profoundly beautiful.

My interest extends beyond flowers. Nature provides a bounty of opportunities. I find that I tend to focus on singular objects.

###Lesson #3: The Camera is a Tool

This is still something that I am learning. Many of us have a preconceived notion of what photography is, and it limits what we create. Ultimately the camera is a box that captures light. It is up to us what kind of light we want to expose it to.

My background is in painting and drawing, so I started experimenting with combining painting with photography. I wanted to depict something that was not possible to create with paint alone, so I made a transitory painting and photographed it.

The painting only existed for a few moments. I was liquid floating on glass, so even as I was capturing images it was flowing and changing. This taught me an important lesson. Cameras are tools; people provide the vision.
