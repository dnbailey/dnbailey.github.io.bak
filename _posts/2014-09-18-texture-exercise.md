The way light plays across the surface of a material is fascinating to me. Everyday objects become landscapes wrapped in shadows. Recently I have been photographing surface textures as a creative exercise.

I have always looked closely at things. I spent much of my childhood being nearsighted without corrective lenses. I thought everyone saw the world out of focus unless they were inches away. As a result, I love to get my camera in close to my subject.

Using a single light source, I have been experimenting with ways of transforming mundane materials. The image above was some paper from the bottom of a pizza box. I liked the transparency of the paper and the way the paper fibers caught the light. For me creating images is more than just being true to reality.

I have also been playing around with imagery that is out of focus. I think that it helps distance the viewer from the literal object. Instead the viewer is presented with a formal composition of texture, color, and shadow. I guess I am channeling some of the things Iâ€™ve been studying about early twentieth century [Pictorialism](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pict/hd_pict.htm).

I plan to continue experimenting with these macro textures. I hope to find something that can resonate with other people. More importantly I hope to capture my view of the world. The Pictorialist philosophy continues to influence my photography, and I plan to continue learning about the pioneers of fine art photography.
