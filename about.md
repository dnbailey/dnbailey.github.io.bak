My name is Nathan Bailey, and I'm an artist. By day, I work as an art teacher. By night, I entertain myself with various creative endeavors. Teaching is my calling. I've never had more fun than showing someone that they can indeed draw.

I'm a pretty big geek. I love to make stuff. Board games are awesome, and I read fantasy/sci-fi books until the early hours of the morning.

A native of Tennessee, I call Kingsport home now. I enjoy waking up and seeing the mist wind its way through the mountains.

You should follow me on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/dnbailey).
