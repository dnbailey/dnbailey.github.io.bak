## Microcosm

Tiny worlds surround us just out sight. I have always been fascinated with the small and unseen. Advancement in microscopy has removed the veil between the micro world and the visible, but the mystery of these tiny world remains.

Using experimental photography, I have embraced the imagery of the small.

## The Illustrated Man

Ray Bradbury's Illustrated Man is one of my favorite sci-fi works. I really enjoy the bleak outlook on mankind contrasted with the raw beauty of nature. While these images are based on the short stories, they are not necessarily illustrations. They are my response to Bradbury.

## Glitch Art

These are a few of my experiments with glitches, pixelation, and digital distruction.
