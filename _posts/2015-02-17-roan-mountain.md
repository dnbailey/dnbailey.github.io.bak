The last couple of months have been a time of loss and rediscovery. I've been seeing the world around me with fresh eyes. The world truly is truly beautiful. It is very easy to overlook the beauty around us in the rush of everyday life.

Nature has always been a solace for me. From staring at the stars on a warm summer night to battling the cold for a stunning vista, I had forgotten how much I need to reconnect to the outdoors.

On a whim I drove to Roan Mountain State Park early one morning. Winding roads were bordered by packed snow. As I drove up to Carver's Gap the snow became deeper. Water which had spilled down the mountain stood frozen in place - a crystal waterfall.

The wind on the Round Bald just above Carver's Gap was amazing. My eyes were watering every time I tried to focus on my viewfinder. The smell was intoxicating - clean, pure, new and ancient at the same time. 

I hiked in awe of the sublime - both beautiful and dangerous. Rain threatened on the horizon, so I cut my trip short. It was far too cold to be stuck on the mountain in the rain.

On the way home I blasted Philip Glass's Symphony No. 4 "Heroes" as I wound my way down off the mountain.
