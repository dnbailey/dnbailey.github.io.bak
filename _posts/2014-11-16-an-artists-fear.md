To be unoriginal – I believe that is a contemporary artist's primary fear. Art history suggests that this fear is a fairly new phenomenon. The artist John Koenig has been creating names for these "obscure sorrows".

I know that I have been victim of this fear. It can paralyze the desire to create. People like John Koenig remind us that it is okay to create anyways. I create, because I am helpless to do otherwise.
