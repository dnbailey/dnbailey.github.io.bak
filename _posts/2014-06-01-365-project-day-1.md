Day 1 of my 365 project was almost an epic flop. I scouted some locations to shoot Friday after work, and I decided the local dam would be a cool place to photograph. The sun hits the are at a good angle towards sunset, so I planned to go about a half hour before sunset. 

Unfortunately I did not check my camera before I arrived on site. I am still learning about my Fuji X-E1. One of the complaints I noticed online about the camera was the relatively poor battery performance. I took little heed of these warnings.

**Lesson of the Day:** Always check the battery and have a backup!

As soon as I started the camera, it was flashing the battery light, which means it wouldn't take a photo. The X-E1 has a EVF, so I got myself set up and mentally framed the photo. I turned on the camera and managed to get one shot before it died.

Once I got home I imported the image into Lightroom 5. The composition was not very good, but it was pretty sharp. I converted the image to black and white and applied split-toning. Then I exported the image and manipulated it with Text Edit. The process is very experimental, and I enjoy the trial and error.

The final image is close to what I had in mind, but I've learned my lesson about charging my batteries.
