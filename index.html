        <p>I am a teacher, an artist, and a human. Exploring the world visually means I have many interests. Hopefully the things I create can inspire you.</p>

        <p>My name is Nathan Bailey, and I'm an artist. By day, I work as an art teacher. By night, I entertain myself with various creative endeavors. Teaching is my calling. I've never had more fun than showing someone that they can indeed draw.</p>

        <p>I'm a pretty big geek. I love to make stuff. Board games are awesome, and I read fantasy/sci-fi books until the early hours of the morning.</p>

        <p>A native of Tennessee, I call Kingsport home now. I enjoy waking up and seeing the mist wind its way through the mountains.</p>
