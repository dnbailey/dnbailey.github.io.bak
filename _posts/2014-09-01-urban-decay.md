### Exploring My Small Downtown
{: class="text-center"}

While Kingsport is no metropolis, the downtown is classic Americana. Antiques, coffee, and news stands interspersed with abandoned spaces and decaying monuments to another age.

The skyline of Kingsport, Tennessee is dominated by factories and industrial buildings, but nestled in the heart of city is the small downtown. Aging buildings line the handful of streets that makeup downtown. It is full of vestiges of a lost America.

Efforts to renew the downtown have transformed many buildings into chic, urban spaces. It is a fun place to hangout. However, the majority of the downtown is a series of abandoned, decaying spaces. The stories of these spaces are lost to me, but the buildings have obviously seen much.

I would love to explore the names and stories of these buildings. They are merely facades of the lives of the people who inhabited them.

The nature of time is that all things must pass. Our collective memory is one of the few ways to fight the inevitable decay of time. Buildings rot, lives are lost, but the stories we remember live past us. Even stories fade, but I believe it is important that we do our best to remember.
